TALK(1)                     lore://boot Manual                    TALK(1)

NAME
    talk - initiate dialogue with a system-resident entity

SYNOPSIS
    talk <npc_id>

DESCRIPTION
    The `talk` command allows you to speak with an NPC present in the
    current room. NPCs are fragments of memory, orphaned root agents,
    or corrupted user ghosts. Some are lucid. Others loop.

    Dialogue is limited but reactive. Speaking to certain NPCs may:

        • Progress a quest step
        • Grant access tokens or items
        • Reveal critical narrative information
        • Trigger irreversible events

    Most NPCs are one-time interactions. Some remember if you've come
    back. Others forget you every time.

RULES
    • Use `look` to see available NPCs in the current room
    • Use their exact ID (e.g., `talk devghost42`)
    • Multiple NPCs in a room may be part of separate quest arcs

EXAMPLES
    > talk janitor_hex
    > talk arc_agent
    > talk ghost_admin

TIPS
    • Some dialogue requires specific trait levels or items.
    • Others only unlock after reading hidden lore.
