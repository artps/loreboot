SCAN(1)                     lore://boot Manual                    SCAN(1)

NAME
    scan - detect hidden logs in the current system node

SYNOPSIS
    scan

DESCRIPTION
    The `scan` command performs a low-level forensic pass through the
    current node’s memory space, revealing hidden or corrupted logs
    (also known as `lore objects`) that are not visible to `look`.

    These logs may include:
        • Corrupted commit traces
        • Obsolete diagnostics
        • Redacted protocol entries
        • Personal memories from lost users

    Some logs contain embedded effects that will alter the system when
    read — including enemy spawns, unlocks, or terminal reactions.

BEHAVIOR
    • Scanning reveals all hidden lore in a room at once.
    • Any trigger effects defined on those logs will activate instantly.
    • Scanned logs are displayed in full but are not reprintable.

WARNINGS
    • Some logs may lie.
    • Some logs may recognize you.
    • You may not like what you find.

EXAMPLES
    > scan
    [TRACE FOUND] JANITOR_MEMO
    > "Told 'em it's not just heat. It's... awake."
    [TRACE FOUND] GHOST_FRAGMENT
    > "You are the threat."
