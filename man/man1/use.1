USE(1)                      lore://boot Manual                     USE(1)

NAME
    use - activate an item from your inventory

SYNOPSIS
    use <item_id>

DESCRIPTION
    The `use` command activates the functional payload of an item
    currently in your inventory.

    Item behavior depends on type:

        • consumable - heals HP or applies effects immediately
        • cursed     - applies negative effects (cannot be avoided)
        • artifact   - typically passive, but may respond to use
        • key        - may only function when a locked object is nearby

RULES
    • You may only use items that are in your possession
    • Some items are automatically consumed on use
    • Others remain after activation
    • Some items may require minimum trait levels (e.g., wisdom, strength)

DANGERS
    • Cursed items do not ask permission
    • Some items lie about what they do

EXAMPLES
    > use cooling_gel
    > use cursed_patch
    > use dev_override_token
