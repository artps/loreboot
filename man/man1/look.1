LOOK(1)                     lore://boot Manual                    LOOK(1)

NAME
    look - display current system node and its active components

SYNOPSIS
    look

DESCRIPTION
    The `look` command inspects your immediate environment — the current
    system node — and displays all visible components:

        • Room name and description
        • Exits and directions
        • Items available for interaction or pickup
        • NPCs present in memory
        • Enemies currently manifesting

    Use this command often to regain orientation or check if anything
    has changed. Many rooms may shift over time. Others never did.

NOTES
    • `look` does not reveal hidden logs. Use `scan` to probe further.
    • Some enemies do not manifest until specific triggers are activated.
    • Room descriptions may be overwritten by corrupted memory layers.

EXAMPLES
    > look
    LOBBY
    A quiet terminal lounge. Broken LED panels flicker...
    Exits: north
    Items: none
    NPCs: Receptionist Clara
    Enemies: none
