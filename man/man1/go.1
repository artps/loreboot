GO(1)                       lore://boot Manual                        GO(1)

NAME
    go - traverse to an adjacent system node

SYNOPSIS
    go <direction>

DESCRIPTION
    The `go` command allows you to navigate the network of decaying
    rooms that make up Serverness. Each room defines a set of logical
    or spatial exits.

    Supported directions include:

        north   south   east   west
        up      down

    Movement is instant, but not always harmless. Transitions may
    trigger memory events, enemy encounters, or decision forks.

LOCKED PATHS
    Certain exits are locked behind system logic or protocol layers.
    These may require:

        • Specific quest steps
        • Key items (badges, credentials, tokens)
        • Admin-level triggers or irreversible decisions

EXAMPLES
    > go north
    > go down
    > go east

TIPS
    • Use `look` to list available exits from the current room.
    • Some exits will not be shown until unlocked via lore or quests.

    man look(1), man quests(1), man status(1)
