NAME
    lore - access the haunted interface of Serverness

SYNOPSIS
    lore

DESCRIPTION
    You wake up in a loop.

    lore is a terminal-based fiction interface set inside a decaying 
    infrastructure system. You interact with the system through a 
    restricted command-line shell. The logs are fragmented. The memory 
    is corrupted. You were not supposed to be here.

    Your task is to uncover what happened, why it's still running, and 
    who the ghost is that keeps committing to production.

    Type commands to explore your surroundings, examine items, talk to 
    residual memory fragments, and interface with terminal objects. 
    Some responses are interactive. Some are recursive. Some remember.

    Progress is made through observation, exploration, and irreversible 
    choices. This is not a game. It is a reactivation.
