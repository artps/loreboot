EXAMINE(1)                  lore://boot Manual                 EXAMINE(1)

NAME
    examine - inspect a specific item or lore object

SYNOPSIS
    examine <target>

DESCRIPTION
    The `examine` command inspects a named item, lore log, or terminal
    object in the current room or inventory. This provides full detail,
    including:

        • Descriptions
        • Embedded log content
        • Triggered effects (if present)
        • Narrative voiceprints or system echoes

    Unlike `scan`, which reveals all hidden logs at once, `examine`
    allows targeted analysis — and is often safer. But not always.

RULES
    • You may examine:
        - Items in the room
        - Items in your inventory
        - Visible lore logs
    • Hidden logs must be found using `scan` first

DANGERS
    • Some logs contain `trigger_effects`
      These may:
        - Spawn enemies
        - Alter your quest state
        - Apply corruption to your user context
    • Reading the wrong memory can overwrite your own

EXAMPLES
    > examine debugger_badge
    > examine welcome_protocol
    > examine corpse_dev
