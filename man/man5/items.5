NAME
    items - classification and behavior of inventory objects

DESCRIPTION
    Items in Serverness are fragments of data, memory, or hardware
    remnants that can be used, equipped, studied, or feared.

    Each item has:
        • An ID
        • A type
        • A description
        • Optional effects (on traits or health)

ITEM TYPES

    artifact
        Grants permanent trait bonuses. Usually safe.
        Examples: debugger_badge, sudo_token

    consumable
        One-time use items. Often restore HP or grant small buffs.
        Examples: cooling_gel, coffee_sludge

    cursed
        Apply negative effects on pickup or use. Some may not be removable.
        Examples: cursed_patch

    key
        Used to unlock locked exits or complete quest steps.
        Examples: arc_badge, core_activation_key

    clue
        Informational-only. May hint at triggers, passwords, or quest paths.
        Examples: quarantine_report

    debug
        Reserved for testing or hidden logic paths. Use with caution.
        Examples: dev_override_token

TRAIT EFFECTS
    Some items modify player traits (e.g., +1 intelligence).
    These effects stack and persist until removed or overridden.

HEALING
    Items that restore HP are often tagged as `consumable`.
    Healing scales with `wisdom` if above 5.

DANGERS
    • Some cursed items trigger when picked up.
    • Some keys are tied to irreversible doors or endings.

EXAMPLES
    > use cooling_gel
    > examine debugger_badge
