NAME
    traits - definitions of user attribute fields and their effects

DESCRIPTION
    Traits are core stat values that shape your interactions with the
    world of Serverness. Each trait modifies how you experience the
    story, combat, and decision layers.

    Trait values range from 0 to 10 by default. Some items may raise
    or lower traits temporarily or permanently.

TRAIT LIST

    strength
        Affects physical damage output. Rarely used, but deeply felt.

    intelligence
        Used in interpreting corrupted systems, scan depth, and logic
        branches. Some logs or endings require high INT.

    persistence
        Inner resolve. May affect your resilience to cursed items,
        or determine survival in lore-heavy decisions.

    agility
        Governs reaction speed. Affects chance to dodge damage and
        impacts outcomes in combat rolls.

    charisma
        Affects NPC interactions and hidden dialogue responses.

    luck
        Used for critical hits, item find probabilities, and general
        narrative entropy. May cause weird things to happen.

    wisdom
        Enhances healing item effectiveness and final decisions.
        Some lore reacts better to higher wisdom scores.

NOTES
    • Traits are modified by `artifact` items, cursed effects, and
      sometimes by reading specific logs.
    • You can view your current traits using `status`.
