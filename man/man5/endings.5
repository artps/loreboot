ENDINGS(5)                  lore://boot Manual                ENDINGS(5)

NAME
    endings - terminal state selection at the Decision Nexus

DESCRIPTION
    At the final layer of Serverness lies the Decision Nexus — a
    translucent system void containing two terminals:

        ACCEPT    :: Reinstate the Core and let Old Root persist
        PURGE     :: Wipe the system and sever recursion
        LOOP      :: Merge with the daemon. Become part of it.
        OVERRIDE  :: (optional) Inject corrupted sudo token and force
                     an unauthorized ending

    This is the only moment of explicit choice.
    Everything else you’ve done merely led you here.

UNLOCK CONDITIONS

    • OVERRIDE becomes available only if the player possesses the
      `compressed_sudo_token` from the `getSudoToken` quest

    • Additional narrative variations may occur if you’ve read:

        - ghost_admin_diary
        - flicker_of_me
        - scrapcode_cache

    • Trait thresholds (e.g. wisdom > 7) may influence outcome flavor
      in future versions

USAGE

    You will be prompted at the Decision Nexus. Input one of:

        1
        2
        3
        override

RESULTS

    • Your selection determines which ending log is printed
    • Certain endings may reflect on your choices, inventory, or
      corruption state

WARNINGS

    • There is no undo
    • All logs are final
    • Some choices are lies pretending to be choices

EXAMPLES

    > 1
    [ENDING] :: ACCEPT

    > override
    [ROOT ACCESS INJECTED]
    [ENDING] :: OVERRIDE
