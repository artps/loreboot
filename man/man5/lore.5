NAME
    lore - memory fragments, ghost logs, and corrupted traces

DESCRIPTION
    Lore in Serverness represents non-interactive data fragments—
    logs, messages, boot errors, and user thoughts—often embedded in
    physical objects or systems.

    Each lore object has:
        • A name and description
        • One or more logs (strings or hex payloads)
        • A visibility state (visible or hidden)
        • Optional triggers or effects

VISIBILITY

    visible
        These logs appear when using `look` and can be examined freely.

    hidden
        These are only revealed with `scan`.

    You may `examine` either type once visible to activate effects.

TRIGGERS

    Lore may carry embedded fields that change the game state:

        trigger_effect
            Executes a world-altering event (e.g., spawn enemy,
            weaken boss, unlock ending)

        hint_for
            Soft narrative link to a quest or log trail

        reveals
            Discloses a keyword or clue (e.g., a password)

        corrupts
            Tags the player or memory context as compromised

BEHAVIOR

    • Trigger effects activate automatically upon `scan` or `examine`
    • Lore is read-only but not without consequence

EXAMPLES

    > examine log_fragment_ghost42
    > scan

TIPS

    • Lore can spawn enemies or reward understanding
    • Not all logs are true
    • Some logs recognize you
