NAME
    quests - operational threads tracked by the system

DESCRIPTION
    Quests are structured sets of objectives that guide your traversal
    through Serverness. Each quest represents a root issue, failure
    state, or mystery unfolding in fragments.

    Quests are composed of ordered steps. Completion of one step
    unlocks the next. All steps are triggered by in-world interactions.

STEP TYPES

    DefeatEnemy
        Requires defeating a specific enemy.
        Example: defeat-the-ci-specter

    CollectItem
        Requires acquiring a specific item.
        Example: collect-the-encrypted-credentials

    TalkNpc
        Requires speaking to an NPC.
        Example: talk-to-devghost42

    ReadLore
        Requires scanning or examining a specific log.
        Example: inspect-server-logs

    UseTerminal
        Requires executing a final decision input.

QUEST MECHANICS

    • Quests begin automatically when triggered by certain NPCs or actions
    • Progress is tracked silently unless viewed via `quests`
    • Quest completion may unlock rooms, drop items, or affect endings

INTERACTIONS

    • Quests are progressed through normal gameplay
    • Reading a hidden lore log may fulfill a `ReadLore` step
    • Talking to a ghost may progress two quests at once

TIPS

    • Some quests appear linear. They are not.
    • Some quests complete when you are not aware you're in one.
    • You may be a quest in someone else's log.
