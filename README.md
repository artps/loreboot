## Overview

`lore://boot` is a text-based terminal RPG designed to run over SSH.  
You're dropped into a decaying server stack â€” abandoned daemons, forgotten access keys, NPCs with corrupted memory, and cryptic logs.

## Features

- Terminal-native interface with CRT-style visuals
- Modular JSON-driven world: rooms, quests, enemies, lore
- Combat system with stats, actions, block/flee logic
- Full inventory with usable artifacts and hidden effects
- Quests, branching paths, NPC dialog, and gated access
- Hidden commands, lore logs, and flavor terminals (`sudo reboot`, `ls`, `grep -r`)
- Balance economy that links to the Serverness waitlist
